# Project Name

jquery-Server-Side-Calculator

## Description

I solved the problem of manipulating data received from the user on the client and sending it back to the client ad a solved mathematical function.

I used app.POST to bring user data from the DOM to the server in object format.
I used ajax and app.get to access data from the server and append it to the DOM. 

Object manipulation was a big portion of the assignment. Expanding my understanding on how useful objects are and slowly gaining a better understanding of object manipulation. I can see from this assignment how important this is to learn and increase a background on so I will continue research on object manipulation for future use.
